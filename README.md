[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/737cf8c1-bdec-4c8c-8ada-1904c14a1cc7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/aaronlunadev/deploys)

This is my personal website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

The theme I started with is [Mainroad](https://themes.gohugo.io/mainroad/), but there are significant differences since I have completely replaced or significantly altered many of the original layouts/styles/scripts.
