## Project Documentation

`vigorish` is a hybrid Python/Node.js application that scrapes data from mlb.com, brooksbaseball.net and baseball-reference.com, primarily using Nightmare/Electron. My original goal was to only capture PitchFX data, but the scope increased to include play-by-play data, player biographical data, aggregate batting/pitching stats and various sets of metadata such as weather conditions, stadium information, etc.
