summary: "This tutorial series provides step-by-step instructions and in-depth explanations to guide you through the process of creating a robust, production-quality REST API. The toolstack consists of Flask, Flask-RESTx, pyjwt, SQLAlchemy and other packages. Code quality is a major focus, with considerable time dedicated to testing (using pytest), logging and tools such as coverage, flake8 and mypy. The tutorial concludes by creating a process that continuously integrates (with tox, travis/circle CI, coveralls) and deploys the API (with either Github or Azure DevOps to Heroku)."
