        <span class="fa fa-keyboard-o fa-bullet-icon"></span>I am a software engineer living and working in Reno, NV. I enjoy music and sports (especially baseball and basketball) and I am especially interested in the changing landscape of legalized gambling on sporting events.

    <p class="fa-bullet-list-item">
        <span class="fa fa-code fa-bullet-icon"></span>I have 10+ years experience as a developer, starting out as a <strong>C#</strong> programmer before moving to web development in 2016. I have a personal preference towards vanilla <strong>JavaScript ES5/6</strong>, <strong>HTML/5</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, but I also have experience with a number of frameworks such as <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>AngularJS</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>. I have extensive experience developing web applications with a back-end stack implemented entirely in <strong>Python</strong> (<strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>). Currently, I am learning <strong>Svelte</strong> and <strong>Sapper</strong>, which I am enjoying greatly.
