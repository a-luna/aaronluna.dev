        <span class="fa fa-code fa-bullet-icon"></span>I have 10+ years experience as a developer, starting out as a <strong>C#</strong> programmer and began developing websites in 2016. Although I primarily focus on <strong>JavaScript ES5/6</strong>, <strong>HTML/5</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, I have also developed with a number of frameworks such as <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>AngularJS</strong>, <strong>Angular 5/6</strong> and <strong>React</strong>. I currently work as a freelance full-stack developer, devoted primarily to <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> backed applications.
