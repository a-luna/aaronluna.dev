    <p class="fa-bullet-list-item">
        <span class="fa fa-keyboard-o fa-bullet-icon"></span>I am a software engineer living and working in Reno, NV. I enjoy music and sports (especially baseball and basketball) and I am especially interested in the changing landscape of legalized gambling on sporting events.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="fa fa-code fa-bullet-icon"></span>I have 10+ years of experience developing software, starting out as a <strong>C#</strong> programmer before moving to web development in 2016. Whenever possible, I prefer to work with vanilla <strong>JavaScript (ES5/6)</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. However, I am comfortable working with JavaScript frameworks such as <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>AngularJS</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>.
        <p>Recently, I dove head-first into the world of static-site generators (aka the <strong>JAMStack</strong>), creating sites with <strong>Hugo</strong> and <strong>Gatsby</strong>. I have migrated Wordpress sites to Gatsby, created entirely new sites with <strong>Contentful</strong>/<strong>Sanity</strong> and deployed static-sites to <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Netlify</strong> and <strong>Github</strong>.</p>
        <p>I also have extensive experience developing web applications with <strong>Flask</strong> and <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>. Currently, I am learning <strong>Svelte</strong> and <strong>Sapper</strong>, which I am enjoying greatly since Svelte compiles down to vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.</p>
