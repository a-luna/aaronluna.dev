I created this blog because one of the best ways to sharpen your knowledge of a subject is to teach it to someone. Whenever I begin working with a new technology or programming language and I encounter an issue where the solution is unintuitive or especially difficult to understand, I write a blog post about it. Forcing yourself to document a process exposes gaps in your knowledge, which must be filled in order to explain the process to the reader.

Also, I recently decided to create tutorials for subjects that require more detail than a single blog post. The first tutorial will be available shortly, and will be featured prominently when it is available.
